# Internal-Climate-Variability-Species-Distribution-Models
Interactive app exploring how CESM2-LENS2 initial condition uncertainty affects Species Distribution Model projections. Select habitat, species, time period, and ensemble member (1–100) to visualize variability in future distributions. Includes navigation/animation modes and summary metrics (e.g., area change %) with multi-species comparison.
